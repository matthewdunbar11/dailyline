# DailyLine Sprint 1B Plan (Pre-Sprint 2)

**Status:** Planned

## 1. Sprint Outcome
Ship a lightweight UI polish pass that tidies the interface and adds icons to menu buttons to improve scan-ability without expanding feature scope.

## 2. Scope (Sprint 1B)
In:
1. Visual cleanup of primary screens (spacing, typography consistency, and minor alignment fixes).
2. Add icons to menu buttons in navigation/tabs to improve recognition.
3. Ensure iconography aligns with existing theme colors and accessibility contrast.
4. Update documentation to capture UI polish decisions.

Out:
1. Any net-new features or data model changes.
2. Navigation architecture changes (tabs/stack structure stay as-is).
3. Visual redesign or rebranding work.
4. New flows or integrations.

## 3. Build Order
1. Audit existing UI for inconsistencies (spacing, typography, button styles).
2. Select icon set compatible with Expo/React Native and current dependencies.
3. Apply icons to menu buttons and ensure labels remain readable.
4. Validate layout on core screens (Today, History, Insights, Settings).
5. Run unit tests and update sprint status notes.

## 4. Definition of Done
1. Menu buttons display icons consistently across primary navigation.
2. Interface spacing and typography align with the shared theme.
3. No regressions in navigation or screen layouts.
4. Unit tests pass.

## 5. Proposed Tickets
1. `S1B-001`: UI audit + capture spacing/typography inconsistencies across core screens.
2. `S1B-002`: Add icon set and map icons to tab/menu buttons with accessibility review.
3. `S1B-003`: Apply layout polish pass on Today, History, Insights, Settings screens.
4. `S1B-004`: Verify UI polish in simulator/web and document outcomes.

## 6. Risk / Notes
- Keep changes minimal to avoid scope creep before Sprint 2.
- Ensure icon usage does not introduce additional heavy dependencies.

## 7. Sprint 1B Implementation Review (Latest)

### Status Update
- Sprint 1B plan documented with UI polish scope and definition of done.
